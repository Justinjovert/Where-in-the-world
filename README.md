# Where in the World?
Where in the World? is a Frontend Mentor web app project I did. This is the second time I've done this project basing from my first project so naming convention might be complicated. My first one being a vanilla JS.

I've applied routing and hooks to this project. It was definitely worthwhile. I applied what I've learned in React, but I have not learned everything yet. I used ChatGPT for some css buttons and destructuring objects, which will be obvious if you checked the code. I hope in the future, I will rely less on ChatGPT and more on my skills and experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
